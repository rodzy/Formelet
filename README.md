# Formelet ðŸ¦´

A bare bones auth form skeleton, with reusable authentication components for React.

## Getting started

This boilerplate is styled components friendly, so model the view on demand.

### Installation

1. Clone: ``https://github.com/rodzy/Formelet.git`` or press ``Use this template``.

2. Get the dependecies @ ``yarn install`` or ``npm install`` in your terminal.

3. ``yarn start`` or ``npm run start`` to start the dev environment.

### When/Why to use this ðŸ¤”

- Want a quick setup for a Login or Registry phase.

- Need validated forms for the authentification on your page.

- The design pattern is easier to understand when talking about simple auth when talking about CRA.

## Caveats

- Originally made to work with REST API's, GraphQL integrations might be comming soon.
